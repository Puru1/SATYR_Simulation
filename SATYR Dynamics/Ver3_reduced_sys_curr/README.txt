What this folder include/about ?


This is the most up to date repo for the cart-pole/wheeled inverted pendulum. We have the lqr gains for various different modes
that were tested here. Also we have the evetns flag enabled so the simulations stops when the robot reaches some end condition.
This makes this file the most-up to date and realiable for referencing.
